# ðŸ”² Logic Gates â€” CMOS VLSI (Full Custom)

Building on the previous [CMOS Inverter](../Inverter) project, this repository contains full-custom layouts and simulations of basic logic gates: `NAND`, `NOR`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, and `XNOR`.

Each gate has its own folder with:
- Custom layout in Magic VLSI
- Schematic in Xcircuit
- LVS checks with Netgen
- SPICE simulation using ngspice
- Parasitic-aware analysis

## ðŸ§  Theory: Static CMOS Logic

In static CMOS logic, any function can be implemented using a pull-up network (PUN) and a pull-down network (PDN). Each consists of PMOS and NMOS transistors arranged complementarily.

This ensures:
- Output is always connected to either VDD or GND
- No direct current path between power and ground
- Low static power dissipation
- High noise margins and fast switching

## ðŸ§ª Simulation: Spice Models

Simulation uses BSIM3 Level-49 models from the SCMOS `ami05` 0.5Âµm process.

```spice
.model nfet NMOS (LEVEL=49 VTH0=0.71 U0=533 ...)
.model pfet PMOS (LEVEL=49 VTH0=-0.92 U0=202 ...)
```
