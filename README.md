**Welcome to the museum!** Each "exhibit" is a fully characterized digital cell: from basic logic gates to sequential elements, designed using open-source EDA tools. This project documents my journey learning IC design from the ground up.

This is a personal collection of custom VLSI standard cells that I made using Xschem (schematic), Magic (layout), ngspice (simulation), and with netgen (complete verification). As a computer
engineering student at Case, I grew interested in CMOS IC design but felt disheartened because industry tools like Cadence Virtuoso are extremely expensive and not easily accessible to most students. Luckily, the tools I used for this project are all open source and can be easily installed using `apt-get` commands on Ubuntu Linux. A file with instructions on how to install all of these tools will be included in this GitHub repository.

## üìä Documentation Standard

Each cell includes comprehensive documentation:

‚úÖ **Transistor-level schematic** - Clear, annotated diagrams  
‚úÖ **Optimized layout** - DRC-clean with area efficiency considerations  
‚úÖ **Pre-layout simulation** - Ideal behavior without parasitics  
‚úÖ **Post-layout simulation** - Real-world performance with extracted R/C  
‚úÖ **DRC verification report** - Zero violations  
‚úÖ **LVS verification report** - Schematic-layout matching confirmed  
‚úÖ **Timing characterization** - Measured delays, setup/hold times, power consumption

## üéì What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Parasitic effects**: Understanding how layout choices directly impact timing and power
- **Layout optimization**: Balancing area, speed, and power through careful transistor placement and routing
- **Timing characterization**: Experimental measurement of setup/hold times and propagation delays
- **Design trade-offs**: Choosing between different implementations (e.g., transmission gates vs. CMOS logic for XOR)
- **Verification methodology**: The critical importance of DRC/LVS in catching design errors early

**Key insight**: Simulation is only as good as your models. Post-layout extraction revealed significant timing differences that would have caused failures in silicon.
