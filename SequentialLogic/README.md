# ðŸ”² Sequential Logic â€” CMOS VLSI (Full Custom)

Building on the previous Combinational Logic project, this repository contains full-custom layouts and simulations of fundamental memory circuits: D Flip-Flop and SR Latch.

Each circuit has its own folder with:
- Custom layout in Magic VLSI
- Schematic in Xcircuit
- LVS checks with Netgen
- SPICE simulation using ngspice
- Parasitic-aware analysis

## ðŸ§  Theory: Static CMOS Logic

Memory circuits like flip-flops and latches are essential for storing state information in digital systems. They are built using combinations of logic gates and feedback loops.

Key characteristics include:
- Ability to store binary information
- Controlled by clock signals (for flip-flops)
- Static power dissipation similar to logic gates
- Robust against noise and variations

## ðŸ’¡ Example: D Flip-Flop

### Layout (Magic VLSI)

Notice that the flip flop is composed of eight NAND gate cells that we have derived in a previous
module. Four NAND gate cells in total make a D-latch, and there is a master-slave configuration
of D-latches to create this D flip-flop.

## ðŸ§ª Simulation: Spice Models

Simulation uses BSIM3 Level-49 models from the SCMOS `ami05` 0.5Âµm process.

```spice
.model nfet NMOS (LEVEL=49 VTH0=0.71 U0=533 ...)
.model pfet PMOS (LEVEL=49 VTH0=-0.92 U0=202 ...)
```
