# ðŸ”² Logic Gates â€” CMOS VLSI (Full Custom)

This `combinational` repository contains full-custom layouts and simulations of basic logic gates: `NOT`, `NAND`, `NOR`, 
`AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, and a simple `2:1 multiplexer`.

Each gate has its own folder with:
- Custom layout in Magic VLSI
- Schematic in Xschem
- LVS checks with Netgen
- SPICE simulation using ngspice
- Parasitic-aware analysis

## ðŸ§  Theory: Static CMOS Logic

In static CMOS logic, any function can be implemented using a pull-up network (PUN) and a pull-down network (PDN). Each consists of PMOS and NMOS transistors arranged complementarily.

This ensures:
- Output is always connected to either VDD or GND
- No direct current path between power and ground
- Low static power dissipation
- High noise margins and fast switching
